A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties of another.
Encapsulation hides data implementation details.
An object is an instance of a class.
A constructor initializes a new object.
Method overloading means multiple methods with same name but different parameters.
A package groups related classes.
JVM runs Java bytecode.
A variable stores data.
An interface defines methods a class must implement.
An object is an instance of a class.
Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object.
Interfaces define contracts for classes.
ArrayList and LinkedList are types of lists with different performance.
'final' keyword prevents modification.
Try-catch handles errors gracefully.
:Generics allow type safety with collections.
'equals()' compares object content, '==' compares references.
'static' belongs to the class, not instance.
Multithreading allows concurrent execution.
Method overriding changes behavior in subclass.
Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object.
SOLID principles improve software design.
Overriding replaces superclass methods, overloading provides multiple versions.
Singleton restricts class to one instance.
Reflection inspects and modifies code at runtime.
Garbage collection frees unused memory.
Annotations provide metadata.
Java Memory Model defines thread interaction.
Synchronization manages thread safety.
